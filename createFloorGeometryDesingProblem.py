# We will use the solve_pareto_front_representation method but one can change this to something else.
# The method takes the problem instance and a step size array

# The method will create reference points from nadir to ideal with these step sizes
# in this case : ref points = [[5,0], [4.5, 0], [4, 0] ... [5, 0.2], [4.8, 0.2] ... [0, 1]]
