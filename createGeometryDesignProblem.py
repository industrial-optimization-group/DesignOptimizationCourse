# Example on solving the pareto front : This might take some time so feel free to comment this out.

# We will use the solve_pareto_front_representation method but one can change this to something else.
# The method takes the problem instance and a step size array

# The method will create reference points from nadir to ideal with these step sizes
# in this case : ref points = [[5,0,0,0], [4.5, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0] ... [5, 0.2, 0, 0] ... [0, 1, 1, 1]]
# large step sizes => less solutions but faster calculation
step_sizes = np.array([.5, .2, .2, .2])[obj]

# The method returns the decision vectors and corresponding objective vectors
var, obj = solve_pareto_front_representation(problem, step_sizes, solver_method= method)

# save the solution if you wish, make sure to change the name to not accidentally overwrite an existing solution.
# Saved solutions can be used later to visualize it
# The solution will be saved to modules/DataAndVisualization/'name'
