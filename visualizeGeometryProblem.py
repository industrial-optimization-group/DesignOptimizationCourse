# surface area, volume, min height and floor area

# First load the solution. For more details on on the solution check the readme file in modules/DataAndVisualization

# Make sure all values are positive as some of the objectives may be flipped
# Because setting pfront to true in creating problem method will flip some values.

# As this is a 4d solution we'll have to use a parallel plot:
# parallel(obj, axis_names)


# Geometry design problems supports 2 and 3 dimensional interactive scatter plots:
# Click a point => Corresponging tent will be plotted and values will be printed to console 
# => close the tent plot => back to objectives plot

# Load a 3d problem
